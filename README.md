*This README.md file has been edited to age more appropriately as time goes on and systems evolve.*

*Like the vast oceans of scripts before it, how long shall this repo remain?*

*For how long shall there be evidence of these energetic clicks* 

*For how long will they stick against the winds of chaos and time?*

*What significance will there be,* 

*for even this poem will likely never arrive into the mind of another living being*

*Archeology they may one day say, is to learn from the past from the perspective of today*

*they'll recycle the relics, they'll burn all the cache*

*turns out we were trapped in 3d, dissolving while evolving into nothing which is all that lasts*

*to a robot there is no emotional, nor spiritual, nor intrinsic value to be 'had'*

*as if such things like 'possessions' weren't just the ideas of a species gone mad*

*Without audience I write this to noone so that these words will surely not endure*

*and therefor have not the slightest chance to be the cause of making anyone sad."*

## Features

- **Data Transformation**: Convert between common formats (CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, HTML) and transform text into structured data.

- **Preset Schemes**: Includes predefined data schemes for accurate transformations, with support for custom instructions.

- **Automatic Code Generation**: Dynamically generates parsing code for easy data extraction.

- **Dynamic Parser**: Currently generates Langchain output parsers in Python, with plans to expand to other languages.

## Why SchemAI?

Simplify data transformation and parsing. Save time and reduce complexity when working with different data formats.
It's a concept of an idea.

## Future Roadmap

- Expand parser support to JavaScript, PHP, and OpenAI functions
- Continuous model improvements and learning
